<p><strong>KAMPALA-&nbsp;</strong>The Alliance for National Transformation (ANT) has called off its National Delegates Conference that was slated to take place on Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The party was founded by former Army Commander and ex-Forum for Democratic Party president, Maj Gen Mugisha Muntu in 2019.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The cancellation of the conference was prompted by the party’s failure to secure clearance from the Electoral Commission (EC).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s not clear why the EC did not clear the meeting, since Mr Paul Bukenya, the assistant spokesman of the electoral body declined to comment on the issue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>ANT’s acting National Organising Secretary, Ms Alice Alaso, in a Wednesday statement said, “it is simply impossible to proceed with the Delegates Conference.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She said that they are “extremely disappointed by the irresponsible attitude of the EC,” when it failed to respond to the party’s notification about the conference.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Tuesday, ANT party leaders expressed similar sentiments, accusing the EC of frequently ignoring their correspondences.</p>

<p>At least 48 members of the same family tested positive for the coronavirus after one of them travelled from Nairobi to upcountry, the Health ministry said Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe said during the daily Covid-19 briefing Wednesday that the disease has spread across three generations of an extended family in Migori.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mr Kagwe confirmed the infections as he announced 671 new Covid-19 cases. He said 633 of the new cases were Kenyans and 33 foreigners.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nairobi continues to lead with the highest new Covid-19 cases (376), followed by Kiambu 112, Machakos 20, Kisumu 16 and Mombasa six.</p>

<p>The Speaker of Parliament Rebecca Kadaga held a closed-door meeting with the former Army Commander, Maj Gen Mugisha Muntu, and top leadership of the Alliance for National Transformation (ANT).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The meeting that was also attended by Jinja East Member of Parliament (MP) Paul Mwiru, happened in the Speaker’s Chambers at Parliament yesterday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Journalists were not allowed to attend the meeting.<br>But, speaking shortly after the meeting, Gen Muntu, the presidential flag bearer for ANT, and the party’s acting national coordinator, Ms Alice Alaso, said their meeting was only a courtesy call.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It was a courtesy call on the Speaker but also to announce ourselves as a political party that is now represented in Parliament. We thought it would be important for her to know the party that is behind three MPs representing the Alliance,” Ms Alaso said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Background</strong><br>Recently, three MPs crossed to the party. They include Gerald Karuhanga (Ntungamo Municipality), Paul Mwiru of Jinja East, and Mr Kassiano Wadri of Arua Municipality.<br>Gen Muntu said he had accompanied the party leadership.<br>“We came to introduce ourselves and also brief the Speaker about our status as a party but also to give her some of the things we want done,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the Speaker’s personal press secretary, Mr Sam Obbo, in a memo to the press, said one of the issues was that of “Membership to the Inter-Party Organisation for Dialogue (IPOD) in light of three MPs joining ANT.’</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Speaker Kadaga said she was going to consult widely, especially on the issue of IPOD and MPs that have switched allegiance,” Mr Obbo stated.<br>He added: “The law allows any MP to cross to any party of choice during the last six months of Parliament’s tenure.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mr Obbo also said the stakeholders to be consulted include Parliament’s Legal Department and the Uganda Law Society, among others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Delegates conference</strong><br>Both Ms Alaso and Gen Muntu told Daily Monitor that they are disappointed by the delay of the Electoral Commission to clear the party’s National Delegates Conference slated for Thursday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gen Muntu said three letters have been written to the Electoral Commission since July but no response has been given, something that leaves the party in dilemma.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We hope that by the end of Wednesday they will have replied and cleared our conference,” Ms Alaso said. She said the delay has left the party in a difficult position because they cannot procure venue and other amenities required.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The delegates’ conference is expected to confirm Gen Muntu’s candidature and also appoint a new interim national coordinator.</p>

769,"Private school owners fault government on inspection","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Private school owners are protesting government’s move to inspect their institutions without prior information.<br>Under their umbrella National Private Educational Institutions Association (NPEIA), the school proprietors are questioning the Ministry of Education intensions of going to their institutions without notifying them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mr Hassadu Kirabira, the secretary to the ministry’s Covid-19 committee, representing the private sector, yesterday said while they were still waiting for the ministry’s guidelines (which they hadn’t received) they learnt from sources that the ministry had sent teams to their schools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Even today, I was in a meeting with the Ministry of Education officials. They didn’t say anything. Our schools are still closed. What are they inspecting? What are they not telling us? Who will give them information because our schools are closed?” Mr Kirabira asked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said when they met with the Minister of Education, Ms Janet Museveni at the end of last month together with her deputies; Dr Chrysostom Muyingo and Rosemary Seninde, the ministry’s permanent secretary, Mr Alex Kakooza, informed them that he was still drafting the guidelines after receiving the Standard Operating Procedures from Ministry of Health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We don’t understand. It is like they have already taken a decision to keep us closed. You know what to expect in their report. Our schools have been closed over four months. This hurts us. They should come out and say what they want,” Mr Kirabira said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Some schools are already investing in putting the measures in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19. We hear that they are going to our schools. Where are the guidelines they promised us?” Mr Kirabira said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a telephone interview with Daily Monitor yesterday, Mr Ismail Mulindwa, the Education ministry head of the Covid-19 task force, said they are studying whether schools around the country can reopen without compromising the Ministry of Health standard operating procedures.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Every school is currently involved in some level of preparations but this does not mean the schools will reopen next week or next month. They have to have some level of preparations. We are currently doing so many things but the time is not yet ripe for us to share with you what we are doing,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Friday, while speaking on the sidelines of Kabaka Ronald Muwenda Mutebi’s 27th Coronation anniversary, Dr John Chrysestom Muyingo said the ministry’s directorate of Education standards had dispatched a team of technical staff to assess the preparedness of the schools for reopening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said some of the requirements for reopening include schools having continuous flow of water, each student having a personal desk to ensure social distancing and for those in boarding schools, sleeping on a single bed to avoid crowding.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Ministry of Health gave us a very big list of requirements. Different schools have different requirements. Our team is in the field to understand how prepared we are. We have given them two weeks. I don’t know when they started or when they will give us the report,” he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With support from GIZ, Lord Mayor Erias Lukwago last week said they were already installing hand washing standpipes at entrances to Universal Primary Schools around Kampala.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>President Museveni last month said he would make an announcement before September on whether to declare a dead year for education institutions or allow a phased reopening starting with the candidate classes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He then tasked the Education ministry to work with their health counterparts to prepare the institutions ahead of the declaration.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Mr Kirabira yesterday said their meeting with the ministers showed that majority of the participants had already taken a decision to keep schools closed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even before the advent of Covid-19 pandemic, most schools were grappling with sanitation and high enrolment.</p>

770,"Opinion poll puts Museveni ahead of Bobi Wine, Besigye","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>President Museveni was ahead of his main political rivals just before the coronavirus pandemic hit the country, an opinion poll to be released today shows.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some 47 per cent of respondents said they would have voted for President Museveni if elections had been held in early March, a significant drop from the 60.8 per cent that the incumbent received in the 2016 elections, according to official figures from the Electoral Commission.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another 22 per cent said they would have voted for musician-turned-politician Robert ‘Bobi Wine’ Kyagulanyi, the first-term MP for Kyadondo East. Dr Kizza Besigye, who has contested against the incumbent in the last four elections, would have come third with 17 per cent of the vote, down from 35.4 per cent in the last presidential election.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The findings are contained in the Uganda Governance Pulse, a new opinion poll conducted by Research World International, a local polling firm, on behalf of the Great Lakes Institute for Strategic Studies, a local think-tank, and the Independent Expert Peer Group of policy and public analysts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fieldwork was conducted in the second week of March and ended just before the country was locked down to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease. The polling firm interviewed 2,321 respondents randomly selected across the country based on the 2014 census.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although nominations for presidential candidates are yet to happen, both leading candidates in the poll had declared their intentions by the time respondents were polled. In April 2019, the Supreme Court dismissed a petition against the lifting of presidential age limits, effectively opening the door to President Museveni, in power since 1986, to seek re-election next year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Similarly, Mr Kyagulanyi announced in July 2019 that he would run for president in 2021. Mr Besigye, on the other hand, has repeatedly said he is “going nowhere” but has not publicly announced intentions to contest next year’s presidential elections.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mr Museveni has since been nominated unopposed as the ruling NRM party’s presidential candidate while Mr Kyagulanyi’s People Power movement has also morphed into the National Unity Platform, of which he is expected to be picked as flag bearer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Museveni’s performance<br>The poll results show that while Mr Museveni leads the field, he was below the “50 per cent plus one” threshold required to win re-election in the first round.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Opposition is mulling fielding a joint candidate and the split showing between two of its leading lights shows the value of such a strategy. However, the long list of aspiring presidential candidates – at least 45 by one count – will make an Opposition alliance that leads to a two-horse race difficult, if not impossible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><ins></ins></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the poll, Mr Museveni’s support is highest in Bukedi, Lango and Tooro with 65 per cent, and lowest in Buganda at 27 per cent. Support for Mr Kyagulanyi was highest in Bugisu (39 per cent) followed by Sebei (36 per cent) and Busoga (30 per cent). It was lowest in Rwenzori and Kigezi at just two and three per cent respectively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr Besigye’s support was highest in Rwenzori (35 per cent) and lowest in Lango at just seven per cent. Dr Besigye’s Opposition Forum for Democratic Change party made political gains in Rwenzori in the last election riding on unrest between local leaders and the central government, but appears to be losing its grip on Lango, which until 2006 was an Opposition stronghold.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While both Mr Museveni and Dr Besigye have more support in rural areas and across demographic profiles, Mr Kyagulanyi is more popular in urban areas and among male younger voters aged 18-34, the poll shows.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Succession</strong><br>The removal of presidential age limits under controversial circumstances in December 2017 continues to be an issue, and one that is likely to play into the upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><ins></ins></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>About one in six respondents to the poll said they were opposed to the removal of the age limit with 27 per cent in support. Another 14 per cent were non-committal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The removal of the clause allows the incumbent to contest his sixth election but about a third of respondents said Mr Museveni should retire immediately (20 per cent) or at the end of his current term next year (15 per cent).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another 19 per cent said he should retire in 2026 if he wins the next election, while 21 per cent said he should never retire. Some 25 per cent were undecided.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Without Mr Museveni on the vote some 23 per cent said they would vote for Mr Kyagulanyi to replace him while 10 per cent said they would vote for Dr Besigye.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With more than half of all respondents calling for the incumbent’s departure by 2026, it is possible that Mr Museveni would struggle to win enough support to continue beyond that year should he win the upcoming election.<br>The poll is expected to show a high level of uncertainty about the direction of the country.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><ins></ins></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Asked in March – before the wide-ranging impact of the Covid-19 pandemic – about the direction the country was taking, 27 per cent said it was the right direction while an almost similar number (26 per cent) said it was headed in the wrong direction. A majority, 33 per cent, said the country was neither headed in the right or wrong direction, while 15 per cent declined to answer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Optimism about the direction of the country was mostly in Acholi (54 per cent), Teso (44 per cent) and Lango (43 per cent) where the ruling party and incumbent continue to draw down from a post-LRA war peace dividend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most pessimism about the direction of the country was in the vote-rich blocs of Busoga (45 per cent) and Buganda (35 per cent), which could have a bearing on the election.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Respondents who said the country was neither headed in the right or wrong direction were mostly from Sebei (66 per cent), Rwenzori (65 per cent) and Ankole (54 per cent).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is not clear how the Covid-19 pandemic, which has led to widespread job losses and economic pain, has changed the population’s outlook about the direction of the country and, as a result, their voting intentions next year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The perils of polling</strong><br>While opinion polls help tell the public mood at any given point in time, they are not definitive, as Americans discovered with Donald Trump’s unexpected win four years ago, or Britons with Brexit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Strict controls on the collection of data by government bureaucrats and securocrats can also undermine the veracity of responses as many pollsters, including this one, acknowledge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The passage of time and the social, economic and political impact of the coronavirus pandemic mean that while pre-crisis polls offer useful insights, the election is still far from settled, especially the rambunctious parliamentary races.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>How poll was done</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

889,"NRM party bags Shs4b from nomination papers","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) has bagged Shs4b from nomination forms for various party posts, including that of party chairman and presidential candidate for the 2021 General Election, Daily Monitor has learnt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Data obtained from the NRM party headquarters in Nakasero, Kampala, indicate that by close of business on Monday, at least 2,051 aspirants had picked the nomination forms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Source of money</strong><br>The break down shows that 1,112 directly elected MPs had picked the forms with each aspirant forking out Shs2m, translating into more than Shs2.4b.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A total of 584 aspirants picked the forms for Woman MP seats, handing in Shs1.1b.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those who showed interest in running for district chairpersons were 312, with each aspirant surrendering Shs1m, raising Shs321m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Special Interest Groups category, saw 46 aspirants pick the nomination forms and paying Shs92m.<br>But these pay ups contrasts sharply with majority of Opposition parties, which have not charged any nomination fees for similar exercise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>President Museveni had earlier picked and returned his nomination forms for the two top NRM party slots of chairperson and presidential flag bearer for which he paid Shs20m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The position of 1st national vice chairpersons attracted Mr Edward Francis Babu, Mr Hakeem Asiimwe Lukenge, and Mr Kefa Mafumo who will vie to unseat incumbent Alhajj Moses Kigongo.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The seat of 2nd national vice chairperson, female, has incumbent Ms Rebecca Kadaga, up against Ms Deborah Kyazike Kinobe, Ms Jane Frances Amongin Okili, and Ms Persis Namuganza, with each paying Shs5m. Candidates for regional vice chairpersons, who each paid Shs2.5m include Dr Samuel Odongo Oledo, Mr Jacob Oulanyah, Mr Sam Engola and Mr Timothy Jokkene Okee (Northern Uganda), and Mr Peter Aleper, and Mr Jimmy Lokoru (Karamoja region).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Central region had a crowded field of Mr Twaha Ssonko Kiganda, Mr Abdul Nadduli, Mr Abdul Semu Kyabangi, Mr Godfrey Kiwanda Ssuubi, Mr Moses Mayengo, Mr Moses Kalisa Kalrangwa and Mr Muhamad Kibedi Nsegumire.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Others were Mr Godfrey Nyakana Amooti, Mr Jackson Walusimbi, Mr Singh Katongole, Mr Uhuru Salim and Mr Mukesh Shukla Babubhai for Kampala region. Western region will see incumbent, Maj Gen Matayo Kyaligonza up against Dr Chris Baryomunsi, Mr Emmauel Kisembo Diini, Ms Florence Tumwine Kintu, Shaban Bantariza, Mr Boaz Kafuda, Mr John Magaro, Mr Apollo Timugaya, Mr Wilberforce Muhangi Byaboneka, and Mr Rodgers Bifa Tugaine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eastern region has current seat holder George Micheal Mukula tussling it against Mr Sanjay Tanna, Mr John Robert Ekongot, Ms Christine Harriet Akello, and Mr Christopher Buyera.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking to Daily Monitor on the collections yesterday, Mr Emmanuel Dombo, the director of communications at the NRM party secretariat, said the money would be used to run the party’s internal elections ahead of the 2021 General Election.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The money we raised from nomination fees will be used for paying the registrars, buying of polling materials, among other needs,” Mr Dombo said.<br>He also cited other sources of income for the party as monthly contributions from party MPs, local council leaders and wellwishers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mr Dombo dismissed claims that the nomination fees were on a higher side and could have locked out potential aspirants unable to raise the fees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“If it was really on a higher side, would many aspirants have showed interest as they did? This is a control mechanism to limit the numbers that would have thronged us,” Mr Dombo said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The more than Shs4b raised does not include money from those who want to be the party’s flag bearer in the newly created cities.<br>Mr Tanga Odoi, the party’s electoral commission chairperson, on Monday said they were awaiting guidance from the Electoral Commission on the matter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We are now waiting for the Electoral Commission to give us the direction. So for those who want to aspire for the new constituencies, please wait, we shall give you a window to express your interest,” Mr Odoi said.<br>Those aspirants for parliamentary and local council party flag bearers in NRM are expected to return their nomination forms starting Monday next week until August 20.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mr Dombo is opportunistic that the 2020/2021 party aspirants will exceed the previous elections.<br>A quick survey from Opposition political parties, showed a mixed response as some parties said they would not charge any nomination fees while others said they would only levy modest charges unlike the NRM.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The party’s top leadership has not yet decided on nomination fees, meaning as of now, the process is free. During the last polls, we instead gave out money to our party flag bearers to pay as nomination fees to the Electoral Commission,” Mr Kenneth Kakande, the Democratic Party spokesperson, said yesterday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the largest Opposition party, the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC), Mr Harold Kaija, the deputy secretary general, said they don’t charge any nomination fees for any of their party flag bearer slots.<br>Likewise, at the National Unity Platform (NUP), headed by Kyadondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, aka Bobi Wine, the picking of nomination forms is free for all positions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We are not charging any money for those picking nomination forms for any position. By charging nomination fees, we would be discouraging the young and upcoming leaders who don’t have lots of money,” Mr Joel Ssenyonyi, the NUP spokesperson, said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When asked how the party will finance its activities, Mr Ssenyonyi said they have various ways of generating money and not necessarily by charging nomination fees for aspirants.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At Uganda Peoples Congress (UPC), Ms Sharon Oyat, the party’s spokesperson, said those interested in picking nomination forms for party president have been asked to pay Shs20m, which position she said is already filled.<br>Ms Oyat said those seeking to vie for MP, pay a nomination fee of Shs1m and those for LC5 part with Shs500,000.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At Mugisha Muntu’s Alliance for National Transformation party, Ms Alice Alaso, the director for finance and administration, said nomination fees of Shs3m would be paid by only those interested in running for president.<br>Ms Alaso added that the rest of the positions would not attract any charge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We are not taking any money from those aspiring to be the party’s flag bearer for MP and local council positions. We are having an undertaking with them so that those who will go through, will be making some contributions to the party,” Ms Alaso said.</p>

<p><strong>KAMPALA-</strong>&nbsp;Makindye East Member of Parliament Micheal Mabikke has lashed at NUP saying the procedure used by party president Robert kyagulanyi of fast-rising NUP to evaluate candidates to contest on his party ticket in the 2021 elections is unfair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>Mabikke a longtime politician but a newcomer to NUP noted that the party vetting process is shabby with tribalism and cliques and not open.</p>

1170,"NRM tribunal nullifies Henry Musasizi flagbearership, orders recount","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>RUBANDA</strong>- The National Resistance Movement (NRM) party has ordered that the declaration of Henry Ariganyira Musasizi as the Rubanda Constituency East National Resistance (NRM) party flag bearer be set aside to pave way for re-tallying of 16 disputed polling stations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was in a verdict released on Tuesday evening signed by Enock Barata, the NRM’s Elections Dispute Tribunal Chairperson. This follows petition filed by Musasizi’s contender who is also the incumbent Rubanda district LC5 chairman Kenneth Jogo Biryabarema.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Musasizi, the incumbent legislator looking for third term was announced the winner on September 5th after collecting 23,330 defeating Biryabarema who garnered 22,412 votes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the win&nbsp;sparked anger from Biryabarema and his supporters who accused Musasizi of conniving with the NRM district Registrar Aggrey Monday, Gaudioza Kabondo, an official from the party’s National Electoral Commission and Dezi Christmas, the district party administrator to rig votes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Biryabarema on 8th this month through his lawyer M/S Bikangiso &amp; Company Advocates petitioned NRM electoral Commission accused Monday&nbsp;of using a vehicle of Prossy Akampurira Mbabazi, a district woman<br>Member of Parliament while delivering declaration forms to sub-counties yet she was also a candidate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He also faulted Monday for deliberately tallying votes wrongly with a mission of announcing Musasizi the winner, adding that a tally by his agents gave him a 51 per cent win over Musasizi. He also argued that registrars allowed Musasizi to sneak some of the declaration forms inside the tally centre for consideration while tallying.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In his defense, Musasizi argued that his supporters were denied chance to vote in most polling stations in Bubaare Sub County though he continued to fight and won. Today evening, Barata ordered in a&nbsp;judgment that results from 16 polling stations be re-tallied. Some of&nbsp;the contested villages include: Rwamate, Butaturwa, Rukinda, Kamusya B, Bwisa and Kitojo among others where figures were allegedly altered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He ordered that re-tallying should be carried out with immediate&nbsp;effect in presence of both parties and a member of the tribunal. He added that after re-tallying it’s when, the winner will be announced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both Musasizi and Biryabarema did not pick our reporter’s phone calls to comment about the matter. Earlier anti-riot police spent the day in running battles with&nbsp;Biryabarema’s supporters in Bubaare Sub County and Hamuhambo town&nbsp;council who were protesting the delay to announce the verdict.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>protestors who include Pulika Ainembabazi, Ivan Tumukunde, Betty Twikirize and Lilian Bwabuhe all protestors say that&nbsp; &nbsp;they voted&nbsp;Biryabarema overwhelmingly but were surprised how Musasizi was declared winner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Voters from Bubaare were intercepted and dispersed by Anti-riot police and Uganda People Defense Forces (UPDF) soldiers under the command of Tai Ramadhan, Rubanda District Police Commander at Muchahi tradince centre while blocking the road as they match to Rubanda district headquarters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>RUKUNGIRI-</strong>&nbsp;Rukungiri District Local Government has today started off the inspection of education institutions in readiness for reopening of candidate classes and finalists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The inspection is in line with the need for the schools to ensure that they follow the standard operating procedures that were put in place by the Ministry of Health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rukungiri’s acting District Education Officer (DEO) Mr. Jackson Turyahumura while meeting all primary teachers from Bwambara and Bugangari Sub Counties cautioned the headteachers to be keen enough with the Standard Operating Procedures in order to prevent the coronavirus pandemic which he said starts with teachers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking at the same function, the District Health Educator, Alice Kasiisi, told the primary school headteachers drawn from Bugangari, Bwambara Sub County and Bikurungu Town Council that the school must have a committee to give a daily summary report and ensure that the pupils are following the SOPs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;“Each class must have a class monitor who will follow up the fellow learner’s to ensure that they are following the SOPs,” Alice Kasiisi said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The selected committee must identify the critical control points in the school that may cause overcrowding for example at the school gate, staffroom, offices,library, dining hall, dormitories and classrooms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She emphasized that handwashing facilities with sanitizers or soap or disinfections must be available infront of classes, staffroom, dining hall, kitchen, Dormitories for boarding schools and at the toilets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There will be restricted access to schools and screening of all people must be done at the gate or entry point,” She said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Important to note, the DEO emphasised on the availability of temperature guns deployed at all entry points without forgetting an&nbsp; isolation room, where the suspects will be taken.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to that, all learner’s must wear masks and at least every learner must have two facemasks with his or her indentifications and the learner’s must have&nbsp; access to water at all times and soak away pits to dispose off waste water after handwash must be available.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>More so, the classrooms must have adequate lighting and ventilation, enough space of 2 meters&nbsp; in between the students.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Only one student will occupy a bed whether it is single or a decker without forgetting to keep 2 meters distance between beds and all lesson plans should have messages of coronavirus&nbsp; and every lesson must begin with a teacher reminding the learner’s to continuously observe the Ministry of Health Coronavirus guidelines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However some of the Headteachers decried that the exercise was very expensive and  most of them already feel much pressure on expenses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Head teachers honestly said that they no longer have the money&nbsp; for fourth quarter which the District officials&nbsp; expect them to use and account for.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They therefore requested the district leaders to talk to the Ministry of Finance to release more money for them to use.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Headteachers emphasized the need for more funds to cater for the purchase of the items needed for implementation of Standard Operating Procedures saying that they received previously has already been used to clear the school compounds and paying security guards therefore they have no money to facilitate the buying of materials to use in putting in place SOPs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The DEO cautioned private&nbsp; school Headteachers who feel they won’t manage all these Standard Operating Procedures before opening to let the pupils to join other government schools other than making them miss their exams.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Deputy Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) Mr Rubaihayo Stephen informed the head teachers that the schools will open for 2nd term on 15th October 2020 and asked them to inform the teachers to be more vigilant saying that the situation is a matter of life and death which requiress cooperation from all stake holders.</p>

<p><strong>CALIFORNIA</strong> - The first person to be cured of HIV, Timothy Ray Brown -known as the ""Berlin Patient"" - has died after a battle with cancer, the International Aids Society (IAS) announced Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brown made medical history and became a symbol of hope for the tens of millions of people living with the virus that causes AIDS when he was cured more than a decade ago.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He had been living with a recurrence of leukaemia for several months and received hospice care at his home in Palm Springs, California.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""On behalf of all its members... the IAS sends its condolences to Timothy’s partner, Tim, and his family and friends,"" said IAS President Adeeba Kamarulzaman.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""We owe Timothy and his doctor, Gero Hutter, a great deal of gratitude for opening the door for scientists to explore the concept that a cure for HIV is possible.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brown was diagnosed with HIV while was studying in Berlin in 1995. A decade later, he was diagnosed with leukaemia, a cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To treat his leukaemia, his doctor at the Free University of Berlin used a stem cell transplant from a donor who had a rare genetic mutation that gave him natural resistance to HIV, hoping it may wipe out both diseases.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It took two painful and dangerous procedures, but it was a success: in 2008 Brown was declared free of the two ailments, and was initially dubbed ""the Berlin Patient"" at a medical conference to preserve his anonymity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Two years later, he decided to break his silence and went on to become a public figure, giving speeches and interviews and starting his own foundation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""I am living proof that there could be a cure for AIDS,"" he told AFP in 2012. ""It's very wonderful, being cured of HIV.""</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>- 'Champion'&nbsp;</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ten years after Brown was cured, a second HIV sufferer -- dubbed ""the London Patient"" -- was revealed to be in remission 19 months after undergoing a similar procedure.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The patient, Adam Castillejo, is currently HIV-free. In August a California woman was reported to have no traces of HIV despite not using anti-retroviral treatment.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is thought she may be the first person to be cured of HIV without undergoing the risky bone marrow treatment.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sharon Lewin, president-elect of the IAS and director of the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, Australia, praised Brown as a ""champion and advocate"" of a cure for HIV.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>""It is the hope of the scientific community that one day we can honour his legacy with a safe, cost-effective and widely accessible strategy to achieve HIV remission and curs using gene edition or techniques that boost immune control,"" she said.</p>

<p>The executive committee of the National Unity Platform (NUP) has endorsed 380 flag bearers to contest for various parliamentary positions across the country as the party finalises preparations for the 2021 general election.<br>Currently, there are more than 400 MPs in Parliament.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>NUP party officials said the 380 candidates were vetted by the party in the last three weeks in an exercise that attracted 653 candidates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sources within the party yesterday said &nbsp;there was stiff competition in picking candidates for the Kampala Metropolitan area, one of NUP’s strongholds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Some parts of the country presented between one and two competitors and some of the slots were unopposed. NUP did not get candidates for some constituencies in greater North and West,” the source said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ms Mercy Walukamba, the party chairperson for the electoral committee, told Daily Monitor that all the successful candidates underwent a rigorous process to sieve out the would-be incompetent leaders in their various constituencies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“We have selected these people using various yardsticks. Where we could have missed out someone’s competence, we asked them to appeal and a review was carried out forthwith, to make sure we have the right people,” &nbsp;she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On Monday night, NUP released a list of more than 100 MP flag bearers for the central part of the country among whom were MPs who crossed from the Democratic Party to the new political formation. &nbsp; Among some of the notable names on the list are Mr Mathias Mpuuga for Mukungwe County, Mr Abed Bwanika for Kimanya Kabonera, &nbsp;Mr Aloysius Mukasa for Rubaga South, and Mr Joel Ssenyonyi for Nakawa East.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other flag bearers are Mr Fred Nyanzi for Kampala Central MP, Mr Ronald Balimwezo for Nakawa East, Mr Fred Ssimbwa for Nakifuma County, Mr Muwadda Nkunyinji for Kyadondo East, and Mr Lwanga Jimmy for Kira Municipality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the release of the list, the surprise names that missed out included Kyadondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi’s elder brother Eddie Yawe, who had expressed interest to contest in the Kira Municipality race, Mr Patrick Mujuuka who was vetted for Nakifuma County, and Mr Tony Ssempebwa who was dropped in Kyadondo East.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other big names missing include Moses Kasibante, Allan Ssewanyana, &nbsp;Mukaku Lubega, &nbsp;Muwanga Kivumbi and Sulaiman Kidandala.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most of the hotly contested areas in Kampala did not have flag bearers’ names. &nbsp;Sources within NUP told Daily Monitor that there were tight decisions to make after all members who had expressed interest had gone through the vetting process successfully.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By press time, yesterday, the party was yet to release the list for the flag bearers from the eastern region.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The launching function took place at Kisiizi Hospital tourism centre in kisiizi parish Nyarushanje sub county.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The outbreak of Covid 19,financial reforms and lack of staff supervisory vehicles have been singled out as some of the challenges that affected the implementation of the Rukungiri municipal council budget in the previous term.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The rukungiri Municipality  mayor his worship Charles Makuru who spoke to us  at his office on Tuesday noted  that the introduction of financial reforms directing Municipal Councils to bank the revenue collected  as  consolidated fund has made planning hard because the council initially budgeted for the local revenue collections.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The issue of bus-park and taxi-park re-centralization also reduced revenue collections for the Municipality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Makuru added that inadequate transport sources inform of vehicles for municipal staff has made the supervision of some projects difficult.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Rukungiri municipal council for the   last five years  managed to score some achievements like the installation of powerful solar power security  lights along Karegyesa road, Construction of  abattoirs at Nyamayenje and Kagunga markets, upgrading Kitimba Health Centre 11 to 111 as well as establishing a micro scale irrigation scheme in Southern division to improve food production</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Makuru commended the outgoing councilors for the effort  and developmental ideas rendered to the council and challenged newly sworn in councilors to be the ambassadors of their electorate  through raising issues affecting communities for proper possible solutions and urged them to cooperate, be vibrant and work hard in order to have a successful council and a developed municipality.</p>

<p>West Ankole Diocese Bushenyi district has suspended Rev Canon Johnmark Nsasiirwe, the priest of St James Church of Uganda, Kaburengye Parish for  participating in an illegal wedding.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to a letter written by the West Ankole Diocesan Secretary, Rev Didas Natweta to Canon Nsasiirwe dated May 18, 2021, , Canon Nsasiirwe allegedly participated in an illegal church wedding ceremony and allowed it to take place at Kaburengye without adhering to the marriage laws of Uganda.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rev Canon Nsasiirwe is accused of allowing a wedding ceremony between the former West Ankole Diocesan Dean, Rev Canon Nobert Tibikoma and his wife, Evaline Kyampaire, which occurred on May 13, 2021 at Kaburengye.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;The two persons wedded were reportedly not formally registered at least three weeks before and that, instead, they were put in the register after the wedding.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to the Diocesan Secretary, Canon Nsasiirwe instructed the Curate and the lay reader to fraudulently sign the banns of marriage against the dates of the three Sundays as if they were actually announced before the couple’s wedding in Church when they never did.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;The authorities at Bweranyangi maintained in the letter that whereas the Curate and Lay reader admitted the wrong and asked for forgiveness, their Canon Nsasiirwe did not show any concern and remorse and instead insisted that the banns of marriage were published and there was no wrong committed. &nbsp;</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Residents of &nbsp;&nbsp;Nyamirama Subcounty in Kanungu district &nbsp;&nbsp;Bwambara subcounty in Rukungiri district now have a reason to look forward with optimism following the construction of Kyabahanga bridge that will ease transport between the two sub counties and districts respectively &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 10.5 billion Kyabahanga bridge project has been under construction since 2019 by Armpass Technical services limited.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;Locals say the new bridge reduces the cost of &nbsp;&nbsp;agricultural produce &nbsp;&nbsp;between the two districts</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;The beneficiaries further added that a temporary bridge that existed many years ago had put the lives of the residents at a risk especially during the rainy season.</p>

<p>According to residents, the bridge did not only affect farmers and traders but as well affected education since students refused to go to school during the rainy season for fear of drowning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;Earlier this month, MS Peace Agnes the managing director of Armpass Technical services during a meeting with stake holders of the two districts assured them that the bridge will be fully refurbished and handed over to the ministry of works by the end of May this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Kinkiizi West member of parliament James Kaberuka expects the bridge to improve on the tourism sector as well as motivating residents to carry out extensive agriculture because transport costs to and from the markets will be minimized.</p>

<p>By JAVILLA MUGABE</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>The Local Council Three Chairperson for Buyanja Sub county in Rukungiri District Mr Agaba Emmy Rubondo has identified community service by residents as the easiest means to maintain community roads.<br>This was in response to increased outcry among residents of Kihengamo cell,Rubanga parish,Buyanja sub county over poor roads which they blame for hindering  transportation of their products to the market.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The area LCI chairman Mr Crenario Bakacwa,wants the sub county council to prioritize renovation of the road.He said the area produces at least 500 bunches of bananas while others are wasted in the area due to difficult transportation to the market.He said the road was last renovated in 2018 and since then it has been compromised by rains over time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Abeho Fudeli a resident of the area who talked to our reporter emphasized that the area is endowed with a variety of food items that include maize,bananas and coffee,but dont get good prices due to poor roads.He wants leaders to lobby funds from Government so that the road can be improved.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In response,Agaba Emmy Rubondo, the LC 111 Chairman,revealed that the road is already in consideration and will be renovated in the next financial year.However,he urged residents to join hands with their leaders at village levels and do community service so that they can maintain structures like roads.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to Emmy Rubondo roads take a lot of taxpayers' money to maintain and renovate,and sometimes they can be easily destroyed especially during the rainy season but when there timely and regular community service,they can be maintained.</p>

1996,"Opinion: CORONA VIRUS CRISIS;WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY TO CARE?","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fr. Mathias KWEHANGANA</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><br>We are all aware and concerned about the covid-19 crisis both in our country Uganda and the entire World. We are all in a state of fear and anxiety. The days of the week seem to have been extended since the lockdown. A day seems to be a week and a week has turned to be a month for some of us.<br>Our social well being has been threatened by corona virus. Some of the issues that should be considered for the well being of the person include food, clothing, shelter, education, security, medical care and other social amenities. Without proper provision of these the person may not be able to live a life worth of his or her dignity. As some Ugandans are so vulnerable as they workfrom hand to mouth, so food is an issue and an urgent item to pay attention to as already done by government. Others can not breathe and are not in an easy position to access intensive care units. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Due to logistics involved we ask, are we safe? Whose responsibility to care amidst this crisis? Is it only the government? How will Uganda cope with this crisis amidst the cancer of corruption? If there are resources will there be fair and equal distribution?<br>Responsibility towards others means desiring and working for the good of others: our families, the neighbors and the entire nation in the hope that they too will become receptive to goodness and its demands.<br>The care and concern for others means being aware of their needs. Whatever little resources available to an individual or government can be enough to benefit one's neighbors as well. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the President put it while addressing the nation, it is not a time of convenience and comfort but a time of  war and survival.<br>Pope Francis also puts it that "" if there is a will, whatever we have never ends,  On  the contrary, it abounds and does not get wasted "".<br>Christ elevated the value of sharing resources. He said it would be considered greatly at the time of final judgment ( Matthew 25:31-46). St. James teaches that wishful behavior is useless ( James 2:14-17).<br>Contemporary culture seems to have lost the good and evil, yet there is real need to re-affirm that good does exist and will prevail because God is generous and acts generously ( Psalm 119:68). The good is whatever gives, protects and promotes life, brotherhood and communion.<br>For some of the Ugandans who have hiked the prices of, intensive care unit services, food and other household essential items due to lockdown amidst covid-19 crisis, are you promoting life?&nbsp; Do you have concern for a neighbor? Is it your wish to live alone in this country? Majority of Ugandans being Christians, is this a Christian spirit?<br>Fellow Ugandans, remember the word of God guides thus:"" the riches you get by dishonesty soon disappear, but not before they lead you into the jaws of death ""(Proverbs 21:6).<br>In Europe and the United States of America, they have a lot riches whether acquired dishonestly or not is it helping them now? I would ask like Albert Einstein (1879-1955), a German American theoretical physicist that"" How I wish that some where there existed an island for those who are wise and of good will"". Do we still have wise and good willed people in Uganda to care for fellow citizens?<br>Albert Einstein added "" insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results "". At this time of crisis more than ever, God asks each one of us to care and to be guardians of our brothers and sisters ( Genesis 4:9), to establish relationships based on mutual consideration, attentiveness to the personal well being and integral well being of others. So let each one of us be available to offer any possible assistance with in our means and make an effort to protect our lives and lives of others. St. Teresa of Calcutta advises"" if you can't feed a hundred people, then just feed one"". Let this be our prayer, hope and practice.<br>To be Christians is to live as people of hope. This is the greatest gift Christians can offer the world now. Even in the most hopeless cases, Christians must remain hopeful that God will intervene ( I Corinthians 10:13).<br>Let us therefore not live under fear. Negative fear paralyses all our activities and discourages us from doing what we are capable of doing for our own good and that of others. This is why our Lord Jesus Christ who is deeply aware of the devastating and debilitating effects of fear, always invites us not to be afraid ( Matthew 28:20).<br>Let us be people of hope praying with the Psalmist prayer of cry for help that so many troubles have fallen on us, we are close to death, we are like all others who are about to die, all our strength is gone! Lord, restore our nation, bring us back, Almighty God! Show us your mercy, and we will be saved! ( Psalms 80 and 88).</p>
